This data can be found through a Google search or on the respective official websites.</p><p>Please note that different models of the same gun may have different lengths, and folding/extending gun parts can also change the total length of the reference image. Make sure your reference image matches your data.</p><p>For guns, we use the following ratio as the standard model ratio: <strong>1000mm = 48 grid</strong>. For example, a 1000mm rifle can be calculated as follows: x = 48 * L / 1000 where x represents the grid length and L is the actual total length.</p><p><strong>To make your work more accurate, we require you to import a side view of the gun as a reference.</strong></p><p><strong>Example Tutorial:</strong> For example, to build an HM 50B rifle, we first need to find a .png file.
