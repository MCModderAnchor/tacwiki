If this happens, quickly undo the operation with Ctrl+Z and check the model. If a part cannot be optimized correctly by the plugin, it is better to manually cull faces or skip culling altogether.</p><p>You can find Optimize in the Tools interface.

It can also introduce noise during curve color adjustments due to excessive hues and brightness levels.</p><p>To deepen the shadow relationship, pick the current surface color and adjust the value down or lower-right in the color palette; the opposite applies for bright surfaces.</p><p>If you feel only two colors create too sharp a contrast, add an intermediate color between the two for a smoother transition.</p><p>We can use dithering to blend colors.
